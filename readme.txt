My first project in Python.  A game, a store simulator, with three integrating classes (Item, Store, Shopper). 

- creation of store and products
- Store delivery function
- initiating a shopper
- a nice conversation during which the player participates in the simulation of choosing purchases, adding to the cart, removing from the cart, and finally buying products
